# ModernJS Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for ModernJS, a lightweight, reactive web component framework.

## Core Concepts

- [Components](./components.md): Learn how to create and manage components.
- [Templates](./templates.md): Understand the template syntax, control flow, and binding.
- [Dependency Injection](./dependency-injection.md): Manage services and dependencies.
- [Router](./router.md): Handle client-side navigation.
- [Animations](./animations.md): Add enter/leave animations to your elements.
- [Internationalization](./i18n.md): Support multiple languages in your application.

## Getting Started

To create a new component:

1. Define your component class extending `Component`.
2. Create a template string or file.
3. Register it in your router or use it in another component's template.

See the [Demo Application](../app/demo/) for real-world examples.
