## Overview

These core concepts form the foundation of every ModernJS application:

1. **Components** - Encapsulated, reusable UI elements built on Web Components
2. **Templates** - Declarative syntax with interpolation and control flow
3. **Reactivity** - Automatic UI updates through Proxy-based state management
4. **DI** - Clean service architecture with dependency injection

Start with [Components](./components.md) to understand how ModernJS applications are structured.
